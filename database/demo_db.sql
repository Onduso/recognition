That showed a hardworking spirit and commitment to the ministry since you had to work all by yourself without giving up.

You coordinated, and you prayed to many sponsors who had health challenges, they became well in Jesus name. They called you not only a host but a Pastor, this is beyond TVS. \n\nYour excellent time management skills, sense of humor and attention to details made me feel at peace and ease to learn many things from you. All the times, you were the keeper of Your words and therefore dependable and trustworthy to sponsors and donors. Your African dressing code motivated everyone. on 19th you took all sponsors to the local market to purchase fabrics (vitenge), You helped them bargaining and got better price, bargaining is not our culture (Said Claudia the trip leader), but you were there to help. Each sponsor got his/her favorite color. You went extra mile to organize the tailors, who took measurements to the sponsors at Kibo Place Hotel, ensured all sponsors get their clothes on time. I remember you were very tired after long day, but your smile confused everyone not to notice that you were tired. \n\nDespite of you being busy with other stuffs, you managed to monitor tailors (Fundi Cherehani) so that they finish the work on time. \n\nThe execution of the itinerary was done with professionalism and a caring heart, a rare combination. The trip leader Claudia loved and accepted the budget which is another vital part of hosting and planning that is demonstrated by you.  I know God has a great plan for you and will use you mightily in whatever capacity He sees you fit in. As you transition to the PF role, It is my prayer that God will use you. \nYou are a star Remmy!\n\nGod bless you brother. \n\n',	'2019-03-20 10:23:52',	565,	565,	'2019-03-20 10:24:42'),
